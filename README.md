# H138 annotation project 2

This is the digital version of my annotation project.

### Okay, but what the hell is this?

Try it and see.

First, [install golang](https://golang.org/dl/).

Next, go into command line. On Mac, you can just open the terminal app. I can't help you with other operating systems.

Download this repo,
```
git clone https://github.com/laureneliu/h138-annotation-project-2.git
```
change into the directory,
```
cd h138-annotation-project-2
```
and build the executable.
```
go build -o annotation
```

Finally, run and enjoy:
```
./annotation
```
